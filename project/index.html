<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I am a sophomore biology major in the Honors College. I also have a Spanish minor and would like to study abroad in Costa Rica sometime soon. In my free time I enjoy reading and swimming and I am involved in many clubs. Clubs I am involved in include Project Vida, the Neuroscience Club, and the Pre-Health Journal Club. I also work in a Neurobiology research lab in my free time.

I am from Florence, South Carolina. As that is nearby, I get to see my family often. I have a younger brother and two dogs, which are seen in the slideshow. My dogs' names are Cricket (the brown and white dog) and Pippa (the black and white dog).

<h2> My future career plans</h2>
<p> I am a pre-med student and I hope to go to medical school after graduation. I am not currently sure of which medical school I would like to attend. I will likely end up at the one that is the most affordable, and as I am from South Carolina it is likely that would be MUSC. However, I am not opposed to getting to move out of state and live somewhere new. 
</p>
<p id="more" class="hidden">I currently hope to go into orthopedic trauma surgery or dermatology, but I am not sure yet. I like bones and many of the procedures in orthopedic trauma surgery. However, dermatology also appeals to me because I find skin interesting and the work-life balance would be better. Either way I am sure that I will be happy in any speciality I choose.
